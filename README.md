This Simple Shell project is a collaboration between Aalaa Fahim and Reham Saeed, cohort 19 students of ALX Software Engineering using the Holberton School curriculum.
The project focuses on developing a shell that accepts and executes user commands. Furthermore, it parses commands, executes them using system calls, and handles interactive and non-interactive modes. It was a journey to apply process creation, manage background and foreground processes, handle signals, and implement basic shell functionalities.
