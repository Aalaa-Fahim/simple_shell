This Simple Shell project is a collaboration between Aalaa Fahim and Reham Saeed, cohort 19 students of ALX Software Engineering using the Holberton School curriculum. The project focuses on developing a shell that accepts and executes user commands. We created this program to read user input, parse commands, and execute them using system calls. It was a journey to learn process creation, managing background and foreground processes, handling signals, and implementing basic shell functionalities such as command execution, command history, and input/output redirection.
